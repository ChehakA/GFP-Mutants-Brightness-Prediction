# GFP-Mutants-Brightness-Prediction
Predict the brightness level (high vs. low) of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) mutants using amino acid sequence features. The task involves classifying mutants into two classes (high brightness: 1, low brightness: 0) and exploring various feature extraction techniques.
